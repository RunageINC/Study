	<p>It is possible to do a Google search, Reddit search, YouTube search... Whatever... Outside of their platform, by just using a form and an element name that is used as a parameter. Please inspect the code below to check. This is just a funny example, but think of the possibilities.</p>

	<form action="https://www.reddit.com/search">
		<input type="text" name="q">
		<button type="submit">Search on Reddit!</button>
	</form>
	<hr>
	<form action="https://www.google.com/search">
		<input type="text" name="q">
		<button type="submit">Search on Google!</button>
	</form>
